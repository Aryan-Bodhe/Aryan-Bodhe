### 💰 Personal Finance Projects

> Built the following **3 statistical personal finance tools from scratch** during my first internship and took them all the way to production within 3 months.

* 📊 **[Rainbow-Money-Goal-Calculator](https://github.com/Aryan-Bodhe/Rainbow-Money-Goal-Calculator)**
  Engineered a Monte Carlo–based planning engine that ingests historical return data to project goal-achievement probabilities and recommend optimal SIP allocations across multiple asset classes.

* 💡 **[Rainbow-Money-PFHC](https://github.com/Aryan-Bodhe/Rainbow-Money-PFHC)**
  Designed a holistic Financial Health Checker that computes key ratios from user profiles, synthesizes them into a comprehensive health score via LLM insights, and generates personalized, actionable reports.

* 🔄 **[Rainbow-Money-SWPC](https://github.com/Aryan-Bodhe/Rainbow-Money-SWPC)**
  Built a Retirement SWP Planner that simulates historical drawdown scenarios to propose sustainable withdrawal plans and retirement corpus targets.

#### ⚙️ Finance Markets Project

- 🛠️ **[Stock Market Simulator](#)** *(In progress)*  
  A Python + PostgreSQL platform that **mimics a stock exchange**, complete with order-book matching, virtual user profiles, transaction histories, and portfolio management—ideal for testing market scenarios without real capital.

---

### 🤖 Machine Learning Projects

> I enjoy applying ML to real-world problems, from OCR to data structures.

* 🧠 **[Handwritten Math Equation Solver](https://github.com/Aryan-Bodhe/Handwritten-Math-Equation-Solver)**
  Led a team to develop a CNN pipeline that OCRs handwritten polynomial expressions, applies custom preprocessing/postprocessing to correct symbol inference, and outputs step-by-step solutions—earning 3rd place at the Innov-AI-thon hackathon.
  🏆 Placed **3rd** in a campus-wide AI hackathon.

* 🔍 **[Ball Trees Project](https://github.com/Aryan-Bodhe/Ball-Trees-Project)**
  Headed a four-member effort to implement the Ball Tree structure in C++ for efficient k-NN and range queries, achieving 96% accuracy on handwritten digit datasets.
